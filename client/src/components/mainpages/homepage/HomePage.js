                    Keep in mind that this isn't a fully functioning online storefront (yet): there's a bug in the shopping cart/bag, there are no sizing options, the contact form isn't fully functional, and there is no backend or complete checkout process. I'm sure there are other problems that I haven't unearthed. Despite this, I'm extremely satisfied with the results and what I've learned so far. I plan to revisit this project in the future to add a backend and make it fully functional.

                    All shop content (images & item names) was taken from <a href="https://madewell.com" target="new">Madewell</a>. Without their items, I would have had a pretty tough time curating a store.
