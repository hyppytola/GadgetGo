Problem&Solution
Before starting a project, it is critical to do a feasibility assessment. People in the twenty-first century are now content to shop online. Electronic devices, in particular, are extremely popular on the Internet, and the client wanted to ensure that the products were appropriate for them.

The proposal of this project
The major goal of our ecommerce website is to make it user-friendly and convenient to purchase things online in the same way that you would at a store.
